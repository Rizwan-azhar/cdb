You can’t re-sell or re-license any of our stock files.<br>

Using content for unlawful purposes<br>
You cannot use our stock files in a way that encourages violence or for unlawful purposes.<br>

Logos / Trademarks<br>
You cannot use our stock files as logos or trademarks.<br>

Model Releases (Model/Property Releases)<br>
If there’s a recognizable person or property in one of our images or videos, we’ll clearly indicate whether that content has been “Model Released” or “Property Released.” A release means that the model or property owner gave permission for their likeness to be used in commercial projects. If you don’t see a release indicated, you can probably still use the content, but you need to get written permission from the model or property owner to be fully covered. If a clip features a company, brand, likeness, or trademark, you may conduct your own research to determine if use of the image will violate any rights of the third party in question. If so, we advise you to obtain releases from the third party
. Additionally, we do not condone the use of negative “expose” stories that are intended to present any brand in a negative manner.<br>

Stockpiling
You cannot use automation, such as computer scripts, to download or “scrape” high volumes of Stock Files, nor can you do so manually if your intent is simply to stockpile content.<br>

It is perfectly fine to download a few dozen of our most beautiful clips that you think might be useful in the future.</p>
